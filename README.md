Understanding the Problem : Dividing it into smaller sub-parts

Part1: Preprocessing the data
step1: basic pandas to sort the excel file into 3 subparts containing list of infix,prefix,postfix separartely
step2: Sorting the given 50k images using command prompt 

Part2: Training & a Convolution Neural Network based model for sorting images in 3 subgroups : Infix, Prefix & Postfix
step1:
step2:
step3:

Part3: Recognizing handwritten binary mathematical expression
step1
step2
step3

Part4: Evaluating the given expression
Using basic python to code a evaluate function in which string & type of expression is given as input and it evaluates the value of binary mathematical expression given in
